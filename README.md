The [PLCnext DDS-App Examples](https://github.com/PLCnext/PLCnext_DDS_App) repository is a collection of various DDS-App sample projects for PLCnext Technology controllers. 
It is assumed that the reader has basic know-how of the PLCnext Engineer IDE and has read the key parts of the [PLCnext Info Center](https://www.plcnext.help/).  
Each example explains one or more topics on how to use DDS App with PLCnext Technology. Explanations are given in the *README.md* document and via comments in the example project. 
Each example holds separate user DDS-App configurations which can be used on a *PLCnext Control*. 

This project aims to supply, over time, examples and best practices of PLCnext Technology applications regarding DDS-App.
